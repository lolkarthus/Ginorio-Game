Interitus was on his way to attack the capital but was stopped by Alexander the great hero, but alas Alexander was killed. Before his death Alexander managed to wound the beast who made a hasty journey back to his den to recover. What you hear is quite worrisome, yet also very exciting. After hearing this news what do you decide to do?

When your father lets in the disheveled man, your father orders you to leave the room at once. Wanting to know more you cup your hand at the door peeking inside. The messenger explains that Interitus the Destroyer has awakened once more and seeks revenge. He was nearly killed at the capital of Rehmont, but he took down with him the great hero Alexander. The dragon must have returned to his lair to nurse his wounds, but who knows when he shall return. Hearing this strikes fear into you. You’ve always wanted to leave the stuffy castle and see the world. Now’s your moment. What will you make of it?
